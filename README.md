### Algorithms Practice
While reviewing The Algorithm Design Manual (3rd Edition), I decided to implement some examples and problems.

#### Notes:
- These are for my practice. Some classes will have test cases to verify correctness, while others might not have such test cases. There is no guarantee of correctness in any part of the implementations.
- Comments and corrections are welcome.
- I decided to make this repository public, hoping that some implementations or ideas might be of value to others.
- Use of any part of this repository is allowed, and there is no need for attribution. And no guarantee for correctness. So feel free to use it at your own risk.

#### Attribution:
I have looked at studied others' implementations of some of the examples. So I might have borrowed some ideas or code fragments from other sources.
I try to keep attributions in comments, but I might have mislocated those in refactorings of the code, and some might have gone missing.
